Frontend websites are built and run in users' browsers. Usually though we want to minimize the amount of calculations our customers' browsers are performing. The reason for this is we can't assume that all of our users have really good computers. The Backend portion of the frontend is focused on building out servers that will do some data processing and packaging for frontends to do as little as possible thus increasing performance. Another reason for these backends is to proxy credentialing to company internal applications.
