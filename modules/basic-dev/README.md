# What is the web?

## Rationale

This module at a high level describes the internet. How it's different than other types of coding jobs. We'll also go into what some of the day to day of a coder would be like. The plan here is to start dipping your toes into the technological landscape you're about to embark on. The resources that you read through here are not to be memorized but more to help provide you the context/roadmap for what a career in web development looks like. Some of these resources I've gone back to over and over again throughout the years.

## Learning Objectives

- Students must be able to explain at a high level how my computer connects to your computer over the internet.

## Level of Learning

Students should know the above concepts exist. They should also be able to find the answer for what each piece of critical content via a search.

## Deliverable

Upon completion of this lesson, the student will have an understanding that computers connect to each other via a network and that there are addresses involved.

## Critical content

- How can computers physically/wirelessly talk with each other?
- What is a router and what does it do?
- What is a modem?
- What makes the internet different than other networks?
- What is an ISP?
- What is an IP Address?
- What is the difference and relationship between Client vs server?
- What is TCP/IP?
- What is DNS?
- What is HTTP?
- What are some examples of files you may find on a website?

# JS Foundations

## Rationale

Whether working on the frontend, backend, or devops developers need to use a programming language. Javascript is the only language that works in all three domains. This fundamentals section covers the basic syntax necessary of which each course builds on top of. This is like learning a foreign language, where here you will learn vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson students should be able to debug Javascript code using the console. They should also be able to manipulate Javascript objects and arrays using loops and boolean statements.

## Level of Learning

Students should be able to perform critical content tasks from muscle memory. They should not have to look up the syntax for any of the critical content tasks.

## Critical Content

- Describe Javascript's main use on the web
- Demonstrate the use of a variable
- Understand what an Application Programming Interface (API) is
- List some browser APIs
- List some third party APIs
- Understand the order Javascript runs
- Understand interpreted vs compiled code
- Understand server side vs client side
- Load Javascript to a web page
- Use Javascript comments

- Debug and log (console.log, browser `console` tab, Nodejs or browser console)
- Create/update variables with any data type (string, boolean, integer)
- Create conditional statements (if/else)
- Create loops (for/while)
- Create/update arrays
- Create functions
- Create/update objects
