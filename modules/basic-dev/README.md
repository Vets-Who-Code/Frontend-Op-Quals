# What is the web?

## Rationale

This module at a high level describes the internet. How it's different than other types of coding jobs. We'll also go into what some of the day to day of a coder would be like. The plan here is to start dipping your toes into the technological landscape you're about to embark on. The resources that you read through here are not to be memorized but more to help provide you the context/roadmap for what a career in web development looks like. Some of these resources I've gone back to over and over again throughout the years.

You will not be running into this networking terminology day to day at work. However, knowing your domain is going to give you a big leg up in the work place. It's important to know the history of our field because you'll probably interview with more senior folks. It was not that long ago when websites were served off of servers in some organizations' basements (some still are, I'm looking at you government). Some of those individuals who were in charge of those servers are now in director, vp, and CTO roles.

This knowledge sets developers apart and shows that you're interested in taking the time to build empathy in this field. I can't tell you the amount of times where just knowing a key word about a particular technology has opened relationships and opportunities for me in our field.

I want to conclude this by saying I believe that having this module in here is a contentious subject. Because it will not affect your daily work routine some will find it as unnecessary. I want you to be aware that I am saying that going above and beyond basic requirements of knowledge is actually necessary to get a job in tech these days. It is important to be able to have technical conversations with a diverse set of people.

## Learning Objectives

- Students should be able to explain at a high level how my computer connects to your computer over the internet.

## Level of Learning

Students should know the above concepts exist. They should also be able to find the answer for what each piece of critical content via a search.

## Deliverable

Upon completion of this lesson, the student will have an understanding that computers connect to each other via a network and that there are addresses involved.

## Critical Content

- How can computers physically/wirelessly talk with each other?
- What is a router and what does it do?
- What is a modem?
- What makes the internet different than other networks?
- What is an ISP?
- What is an IP Address?
- What is the difference and relationship between Client vs server?
- What is TCP/IP?
- What is DNS?
- What is HTTP?
- What are some examples of files you may find on a website?

# JS Foundations

## Rationale

Whether working on the frontend, backend, or devops developers need to use a programming language. Javascript is the only language that works in all three domains. This fundamentals section covers the basic syntax necessary of which each course builds on top of. This is like learning a foreign language, where here you will learn vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure.

All programing/computing is built on top of the concept of binary states. Boolean logic gives us the ability to input values and output different values. Programming languages make it easier to write boolean logic. The reason loops are so important is we can automate boolean tests (conditional statements if/else). Booleans can be confusing for humans to read, so we put that confusing logic inside of functions, which help us organize things. We store values in variables so that we can later test them with booleans.

As programs get more complicated we want to store those values in more complex data structures. For example, if we have a sequential list of values we could store them in an array. If we have values with custom labels we can store those in objects. These data structures are central to building complexity. In the future you may learn about even more complex data structures. But those ones are very specific to certain situations. Arrays and objects are general purpose data structures that you'll end up using day to day at work.

Loops, conditional statements, and advanced data structures (objects/arrays) add complexity to your programs. This makes it harder to know what's going on. This makes debugging programs so much more helpful. It'll be important to create complex programs so that you run into errors, read those errors and fix them. Also adding logging statements will help figure out variables' values at certain points in your codes' execution. Learning how to debug will be a consistent skill that you build up over time. It is also a skill transferrable between programming languages, systems, and different contexts. The main reason every programming lesson you'll see starts with logging `Hello, world!` to output. That way you can actually start debugging your programs as you learn the syntax of that language.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson students should be able to debug Javascript code using the console. They should also be able to manipulate Javascript objects and arrays using loops and boolean statements. The syntax here is foundational and is transferable to any programming language.

## Level of Learning

Students should be able to perform critical content tasks from muscle memory. They should not have to look up the syntax for any of the critical content tasks.

## Critical Content

- Describe Javascript's main use on the web
- Demonstrate the use of a variable
- Understand what an Application Programming Interface (API) is
- List some browser APIs
- List some third party APIs

- Understand interpreted vs compiled code
- Understand server side vs client side
- Load Javascript to a web page
- Use Javascript comments

- Debug and log (console.log, browser `console` tab, Nodejs or browser console)
- Create/update variables with any data type (string, boolean, integer)
- Create conditional statements (if/else)
- Create loops (for/while)
- Create/update arrays
- Create functions
- Create/update objects
