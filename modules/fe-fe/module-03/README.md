# Design intro

## Rationale

Now that you have the ability to make some pretty great designs with CSS it doesn't necessarily mean that it looks good. This module covers some ideas to keep in mind when building out designs. As UIs build up complexity it becomes more challenging to decipher what the intended goal of a page should be.

We've all had the experience on a website not knowing where to find a certain button or questioning the intention of a page. This is known as a poor User Experience (UX). UX is the study of helping the user to find the information they are looking for as efficiently as possible. To build a good UI that provides a good UX devs and designers should take time and think about their users' goals before starting to put pen to paper.

Design isn't an arbitrary practice. There should be thought around the reason elements are placed, spaced, and colored the way they are. Knowing some UX laws will help you make more informed design decisions when building your applications. On top of those decisions following a design system will give you specific advice around how to build a certain aesthetic.

Lastly, it is always important to design with accessibility in mind. There are folks out there who may come to your UI that have a hard time with small fonts, low color contrast, are color blind, are blind or many of the other ways that folks could ingest your content. Please don't forget about them when building and designing.

## Learning Objectives

At this point you should be able to create a well designed web page using a design workflow. First you'd write your content. You then would build a wireframe showing the path and buttons you'd want the user to click and look at. Then you'd build a design using the colors and layout that would actually get coded. You'd do all this with UX laws of design theory and some design system tactics to help. Lastly, keep in mind the folks you are building for may not experience your UI the same as you do so keep them in mind.
