# Building with Javascript

## Rationale

Javascript is the primary programming language used to build web applications. The Javascript community has built a lot of tooling to help make writing quality and performant Javascript easier. This module we cover how to build with some community tooling to make more performant Javascript all the meanwhile unlocking the ability to use new Javascript features.

The first technology you're going to need to be able to use is Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM is the repository that the JS community uses to publish code to use in your project. Load a JS bundler like Parcel to add loads of packages all at once and then to minimize your code making it more performant in production. When you load a bundler like Parcel you can add the Babel transpiler which will allow you to write JS code with new features while still supporting older browsers.

## Level of Learning

## Learning Objectives

Use a bundler like Parcel to load JS dependencies and transpile JS code by running a build/start command like `npm run start`.

## Critical Content

- Install npm dependencies
- Use a JS bundler like Parcel
- Use new JS features (like async/await, `let`/`const`, Arrow functions, and rest/spread operators )
