# Javascript Testing and Data

## Rationale

Any programming application you build ends up getting more complex. At a certain scale you'll try to make changes to one part of your code, which ends up breaking another part of your code that you forgot about. At that point there are tools to help you become confident in your code. This is where a Javascript testing framework can really help out. In this section we introduce Javascript testing and data.

"Why data?" you may ask. Well there are three reasons here. Reason one, data adds complexity to your application, which makes it a great candidate for testing. The second reason is that in your career without a doubt you will end up using an API that you'd then fetch data from. The last reason is that data fetching is an asynchronous process. It is very important to be able to understand how to build asynchronous Javascript.
