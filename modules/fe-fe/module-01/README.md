## Rationale

As a developer who builds User Interfaces (UIs) it will be your job to style different components that display like buttons, tables, and text. UIs can get pretty complex. You'll end up layering elements on top of each other thus hiding some elements. It's very common then to later try and figure out which element is at which layer and trying to figure out when you apply a style to an element it breaks another one.

Welcome to the world of CSS. Complex UIs are tricky. So this module we want to give you some tools to be able to debug your CSS. Usually the workflow for CSS is use a browser's `elements` tab to change the style of some element until you like it. Then copy that style into your code. Then save it, run it, and check the browser to see if it did what you think it did. In this module we want you to get comfortable with the browser's elements tab because that is the source of truth for writing CSS.

## Learning Objectives

We want you to be able to solve CSS problems using your browser's `elements` tab. Specifically you should be able to highlight and select elements, read through their CSS, toggle and update the styles and use the box model tool to help troubleshoot spacing issues.

## Critical Content

- Inspect CSS properties of particular elements
- Edit CSS properties in the browser's inspector
- Show box model properties in the browser's inspector
- Troubleshoot CSS specificity issues
