# # What is Frontend?

## Rationale

I'd like to take a moment before we dive into how to build the frontend. I think this is as good a time as any to talk about the frontend community and some of the underlying technology concerns that we face. Also, it'll be key to having conversations about frontend to be able to differentiate it with conversations about backend. The reason here is that there are cultural concerns between the two that should be addressed sooner rather than later.

Frontend web development as a career is one of the newer software engineer focus areas. In recent history websites were built by general software developers. Some of these devs built out the servers, infrastructure, database and everything else needed to network all the pieces together. The public internet in technology years is pretty new when compared to refrigerator sized mainframes. On top of that powerful web browsers are even newer.

Because our professional specialty is so new, often you will find yourself at companies that still aren't sure what frontend developers do and what their concerns are. Most software is written on top of operating systems, either Windows, Linux, or Unix. As frontend devs we have to support a plethora of devices and browsers. It's important to know about these concerns in hopes to help instill the complex nature of our profession. At the same time I hope that this section hints at some of the reason why our field is known as being unstable and Frontend devs feel like they have to constantly be learning new ways to build on these ever changing, updating, and competing platforms.

## Level of Learning

This module is a high level overview of underlying frontend technology. Students should be able to chat about this topic but not needed to have in depth conversations about the history, differences between browser implementations.

## Learning Objectives

At a high level explain different types of browsers, how those render data, how mobile fits into frontend, and how frontend is different than backend.

## Critical Content

- Explain client-side vs server-side development
- List client-side languages
- Explain cross-browser vs cross-platform vs cross-device
- Explain some common web browsers
- Explain what a headless web browser is
- Explain what webviews are
- List some "Native" (web native) technologies
