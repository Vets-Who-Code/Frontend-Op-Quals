# What is Frontend?

| Section | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Rationale

I'd like to take a moment before we dive into how to build the frontend. I think this is as good a time as any to talk about the frontend community and some of the underlying technology concerns that we face. Also, it'll be key to having conversations about frontend to be able to differentiate it with conversations about backend. The reason here is that there are cultural concerns between the two that should be addressed sooner rather than later.

Frontend web development as a career is one of the newer software engineer focus areas. In recent history websites were built by general software developers. Some of these devs built out the servers, infrastructure, database and everything else needed to network all the pieces together. The public internet in technology years is pretty new when compared to refrigerator sized mainframes. On top of that powerful web browsers are even newer.

Because our professional specialty is so new, often you will find yourself at companies that still aren't sure what frontend developers do and what their concerns are. Most software is written on top of operating systems, either Windows, Linux, or Unix. As frontend devs we have to support a plethora of devices and browsers. It's important to know about these concerns in hopes to help instill the complex nature of our profession. At the same time I hope that this section hints at some of the reason why our field is known as being unstable and Frontend devs feel like they have to constantly be learning new ways to build on these ever changing, updating, and competing platforms.

## Level of Learning

remember

## Learning Objectives

Memorize these concepts so you will better be able to collaborate with folks when building projects that touch technologies outside the field.

## Critical Content

- Explain client-side vs server-side development
- List client-side languages
- Explain some common web browsers
- Explain what a headless web browser is
- Explain what webviews are
- List some "Native" (web native) technologies

## Lessons

- Read Frontend Masters' book [Chapter 1. What is a Front-end Developer?](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#2)

This book is a great place to come for a huge range of Front End topics. It can help to guide you on most of this journey. When you feel lost on what you believe your next steps or what skills you need. This is a great reference. Another good reference is [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/), I'd recommend book marking both the Frontend Masters book as well as roadmap.sh. We loosely follow the Frontend roadmap in this course. So when you are introduced to a new technology you should go to those resources to see how they fit in the grand scheme of your journey as a frontend dev.

### Study guide

- Client-side: A browser that is loaded from your computer
- Different web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Brave
- Different types of browsers: Headless, web, Webview
- Headless browser: A way to control web pages without a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Webviews: way to display websites on mobile (native) apps
- Native technologies: Flutter, React Native, NativeScript
- Server-side: Code that runs in a server somewhere else that sends data over the internet to your browser
- Client-side scripts: Run in the browser
- Client-side languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript
