# Build clean CSS

| Section | Grade | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Rationale

CSS isn't just about building clean looking websites. It is also about writing clean, maintainable code. CSS can get pretty tough to read pretty quickly. Also, usually you won't be writing CSS alone, you'll be on a team. Other folks will need to be able to read and follow your code.

Building layouts with multiple columns gets challenging because at different screen sizes those columns stretch and contract. Sometimes your layout will consist of 3 columns on desktop, 2 columns on an Ipad and a single column on mobile devices. CSS Grid can help you write CSS layouts that make sense when you read them. You define your layout in one spot as opposed to setting up multiple media queries or using a flexbox in a limited way.

In this course we recommend you pick up a CSS naming scheme. You will be typing more and in the beginning you'll wonder why you have to use a naming scheme. Trust us, once it is muscle memory it will help you navigate your CSS files so much easier.

Lastly, because we live in a great world now where we have CSS variables we should use them. CSS variables are relatively new, but we recommend you use them because it'll make writing consistent css easier. It's nice to be able to define something once and use it in multiple places (especially colors).
